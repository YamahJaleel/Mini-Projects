# Smaller-Projects


 Each project in this repository contains only one class.
 For each project there is a small description below 
 
 
 Roman Numerals : 
 The function of this project is as simple as its name.
 The user inputs a string of roman numbers for which the 
 program will then use the char.at() method to recognize each of the 
 two characters making up any roman numeral as one of the
 7 "IVXLCDM". It will then run these characters through a switch statement 
 that adds to the num variable whichever amount the characters correspond to
 i.e X = 10 so num += 10.
 
 Math Contest : 
 This project utilizes methods in order to optimize instead of
 trying to brute force compute. Altough it is a simple math game 
 it requires alot of repeat calculations and repeat code that can prevented 
 easily with methods. For ex: The methods numgenerator() and 
 calcul() are called into account for each of the ten questions the user is asked,
 the methods encouragement() and warning() are called when the user inputs 
 the right or wrong answer.
