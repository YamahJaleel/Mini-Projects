# Smaller-Projects


 Each project in this repository contains only one class.
 For each project there is a small description below 
 
 
 Roman Numerals : 
 The function of this project is as simple as its name.
 The user inputs a string of roman numbers for which the 
 program will then use the char.at() method to recognize each of the 
 two characters making up any roman numeral as one of the
 7 "IVXLCDM". It will then run these characters through a switch statement 
 that adds to the num variable whichever amount the characters correspond to
 i.e X = 10 so num += 10.
 
 Math Contest : 
 This project utilizes methods in order to optimize instead of
 trying to brute force compute. Altough it is a simple math game 
 it requires alot of repeat calculations and repeat code that can easily be 
 prevented with methods. For ex: The methods numgenerator() and 
 calcul() are called for each of the ten questions the user is asked
 in order to generate random numbers and calculate (sum of said numbers),
 the methods encouragement() and warning() are called when the user inputs 
 the right or wrong answer to output a string ("Great job !!!").
 
 Craps : 
 The basic game of craps is played with two dice. The first roll of these dice determines 
 your point and from the second roll onward your playing the odds. In java we 
 can easily replicate this by using the random variable type. We can initialize
 two dice variables and then create a method roledice() which is called upon for each roll.
 By using a switch statement we can determine wether the player has won or lost.
