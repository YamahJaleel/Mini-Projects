# Smaller-Projects


 Each project in this repository contains only one class.
 For each project there is a small description below 
 
 
 Roman Numerals : 
 The function of this project is as simple as its name.
 The user inputs a string of roman numbers for which the 
 program will then use the char.at() method to recognize each of the 
 two characters making up any roman numeral as one of the
 7 "IVXLCDM". It will then run these characters through a switch statement 
 that adds to the num variable whichever amount the characters correspond to
 i.e X = 10 so num += 10.
