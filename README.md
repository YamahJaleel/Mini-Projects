1. Roman Numerals Converter:

The "Roman Numerals" project is designed to convert Roman numerals into their corresponding decimal values. When a user inputs a string of Roman numerals, the program analyzes each character to recognize one of the seven Roman numeral symbols: 'I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', and 'M'. It then employs a switch statement to accumulate the decimal value represented by these characters, updating a variable as it goes. This project showcases how to handle character-based input and process it to produce meaningful numeric output.

2. Math Contest Game:

While it may appear to be a simple math game, the "Math Contest" project involves a lot of repetitive calculations and code execution, which can be efficiently managed through methods. This project typically includes methods like numgenerator() and calculate(), which are invoked for each of the ten questions presented to the user. These methods generate random numbers and perform calculations, such as finding the sum of these numbers. Additionally, methods like encouragement() and warning() are employed to provide user feedback upon receiving correct or incorrect answers, enhancing the user experience. This project demonstrates the benefits of modularizing code for improved readability and maintainability.

3. Craps Game Simulator:

The "Craps" project simulates the popular dice game known as Craps. In the basic version of the game, two dice are rolled, and the outcome of the first roll establishes a player's "point." Subsequent rolls involve wagering on whether the player can roll the same point again before rolling a 7. In Java, this game can be effectively replicated using random number generation. The project initializes two dice variables and implements a method called rollDice(), which is invoked for each roll. A switch statement is then utilized to determine whether the player has won or lost based on the sum of the two dice. This project showcases how to model real-world games and scenarios using programming concepts like randomization and conditional statements.

These projects highlight different aspects of programming, from character manipulation and modular code design to simulating real-world games. They provide valuable hands-on experience in solving problems and implementing solutions using Java.
